2006-01-01  Release PAMIE 2.0 Alpha
====================================
A whole new start!  The whole PAMIE structure has been revamped, reorganized, reworked and redone.  In addition to this, the main features of this release are full support for frames, forms (or not!), optional debugging, optional fancy HTML reporting, consistent function naming, many new functions, and much much more.  Your old PAMIE scripts are going to need some updating, but it is well worth it.  A build certification script (buildCert.py) has also been included that will not only validate the PAMIE builds, but will serve as an excellent example script on how to use the various PAMIE methods.  You should take a look at it and run it first.  Please remember this is an Alpha release so we can hear some feedback, so don't go throwing this into a production environment.
